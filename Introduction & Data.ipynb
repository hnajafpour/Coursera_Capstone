As a result of this, business owners look at the potential to build their business there, and would like the determining factors in deciding which district it would be preferable to set up in."

Using Foursquare data in tandem with the dataset acquired from https://data.police.uk/, we will seek to find any sort of linear relationship between Crimes Committed and Venues in the Greater Manchester area.\n\nThese datasets will give us ample information on the correlation between crimes and venues in Greater Manchester."

The data included data regarding districts not in Greater Manchester, such as Cheshire East, Rossendale, Warrington, and West Lancashire, so the rows relating to crimes in these districts will be removed and disregarded as well.\n\nFoursquare data will also be used in order to retrieve the number of venues - for leisure, entertainment, sports, food, etc. - in each district, to subsequently compare to the number of crimes there exists per district in a new dataset, and we shall append a column to this dataset consisting of the number of crimes per district in Greater Manchester.\n"
